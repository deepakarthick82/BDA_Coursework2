MiniNet, a competitor to Netflix, provides an online streaming service for TV shows and videos. Users can subscribe to different plans, stream content, and leave reviews or mark content as favourites. To effectively manage this data, there is a need to design robust and scalable database that enables the company to run business. 
To implement this, we started by designing a logical design of the database (Entity Relationship Diagram) and then move to physical implementation using a RDMS â€“ MySQL. Also, a NoSQL database management system (Apache Cassandra) was used to demonstrate a NoSQL approach solution. 
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google was used to implement and create these resources. GCP provides a wide range of products and services, including computing power, data storage, databases, networking, machine learning, and more. GCP enables businesses and individuals to build, deploy, and scale applications and services without the need for managing physical or local infrastructure.
This report focuses on technical description of the project workflow. The first section discusses the database architecture (entities, relationship, and constraints), the implementation scripts, and data insertion. In the second section, we validate and interact with database with SQL commands as well Python (Jupyter Notebook). In the last section, Apache Cassandra instance was created and was validated with CQL and Python.
